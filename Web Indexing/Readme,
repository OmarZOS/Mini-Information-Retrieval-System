LabWork 2 : 

- Today's morning problem was because I mixed the index and posting list files.

- I had in many times faced NaN problems because of the classes (Float|Double) that I had to deal with manually by replacing them with boolean values in many times.

- The Labwork is mainly implemented in the Comparator.java file..
